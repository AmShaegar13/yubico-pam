pam_yubico NEWS -- History of user-visible changes.             -*- outline -*-

* Version 1.15 (unreleased)

* Version 1.14 (released 2009-03-24)

** Quick release to sync release archive with svn code.

* Version 1.13 (released 2009-03-24)

** Fix parsing of password into OTP/ID/password.
Earlier string handling may have been incorrect for short strings.

** Don't pass integers via pam_set_data/pam_get_data.
May solve problems on 64-bit platforms.  Based on patch from
forum.yubico.com.

* Version 1.12 (released 2009-03-24)

** Add support for "use_first_pass" and "try_first_pass".
They work similar to other PAM modules, see README for more
documentation.

Upgrade notice: If you are relying on getting the Yubikey OTP from an
earlier PAM module, and no prompting by the pam_yubico module, you
need to add "try_first_pass" to preserve the same behaviour.

* Version 1.11 (released 2009-02-11)

Contributed by Gregory Brusick <gregory@brusick.ch>.

* Version 1.10 (released 2009-01-13)
